# Settings

The yang-lsp allos the user to configure various settings, though setting files.
A setting file has the name `yang.settings` and can be located 
 - at the root of a project
 - in the user's directory under `~/.yang/yang.settings`.
 
The file syntax is a JSON.

## Disable Code Lens

If you don't want to see the code lenses you can turn it of with the following property:

```json
{
  "code-lens-enabled" : "off"
}
```

## Excluded Paths

Many IDEs and tools copy YANG files into another folder within the same project. As the YANG LSP treats all files within a project the same, this usually infers issues about duplicate elements. To avoid that, you can exclude several directories in the project setting `excludePaths`, e.g.

```json
{
   "excludePaths": "build:bin"
}
```

exludes the default output folder of Maven/Gradle and Eclipse JDT. The path elements are project relative directory names. You can specify multiple elements separated with a colon. The file separator is always `/` independent from the OS.

## YANG Libraries

Often you don't specify a self contained set of YANG models but rely on existing standard libs instead, e.g. from the IETF. Thes don't necessarily reside in your workspace. To specify such libraries, use `yangPath`

```json
{
  "yangPath": "/my/home/yang/libs/rift.zip"
}
```

You can specify individual files, directories (contents will be added recursively) or ZIP files. The file name format is OS specific, and so is the path separator (`;` on Windows, `:` elsewhere).

## Extensions

The settings is used to register an extension. Please find the details [here](Extensions.md).

## Diagnostics

The user can change the severity of diagnostics, by setting the value of a diagnostic preference key to either
 - `"error"`
 - `"warning"`
 - `"ignore"`

The settings contains a `diagnostics` section in which the serverioties for the below diagnostics can be adjusted.
An example :
```json
{
  "diagnostic" : {
    "xpath-linking-error" : "error"
  }
}
```
